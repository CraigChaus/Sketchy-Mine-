      <p class="text-left p-2">
        As the drawing team you are meant to draw on the canvas a word that is
        randomly given to you by the game within a displayed amount of time. You
        must make sure the drawing is as clear as possible for the other team to
        guess easily. The clearer the drawing, the more points you can get by
        allowing other teams to guess quicker. Otherwise the uglier the drawing
        then obviously the less points you will earn cause of giving the other
        teams a hell of a difficult time guessing what ever you drew.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-center p-2 underline">Guessing Team</h2>
      <p class="text-left p-2">
        As the guessing team you are meant to guess what the drawing team is
        drawing. They will be told what to draw but you wont know what they were
        told to draw anyway. As they are drawing you can throw in your guesses.
        Up to 3 different guesses can be locked in and shown for the rest of the
        team to agree and click on to count it as a vote. The guess word that
        has the most votes will be deemed as the final answer. It is only at the
        end of the round where the correct guess word is revealed. If your guess
        is correct then it depends on the amount of time it took for your team
        to vote for the final guess word on how much digging points you will
        earn. The greater the time taken the less you earn, the less time taken
        then the better! And that's what you need to win ofcourse.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-center p-2 underline">PLEASE TAKE NOTE...</h2>
      <p class="text-center p-2 ">
        The drawing and guessing teams are selected at random but every team
        gets a taste of each role in the end.
