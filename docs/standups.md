## SCRUM Standup (Group 2) - 01.03.2022

- Was a quick SCRUM meeting to assign new task to those who were done with their tasks
- Present: Filippos, Vedat (SCRUM master), Peter
- Goal:
  - Assign new items to Peter and Filippos
  - Help Vedat with his code
- Peter: Got task `US04-BI03`
- Filippos: Got task `US04–BI08`
- Other
  - Had a long discussion on what to do with Marko's tasks as we have no idea on the progress of his 2 tasks (other than some work being up on GitLab) and one task is vital for the demo for the publisher
  - No decision has been made: Hoping Marko will do his task in time and we won't take over in case he has made progress
