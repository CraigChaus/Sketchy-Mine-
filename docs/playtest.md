# Playtest

---

## **Sprint 3** - End 1st week playtest

- spectators can't see the time
- the guessed word is not visible enough, they didn't see it and they started drawing something randomly
- the guessed word should not be coloured after they guessed (Michael)
- fix the teams' numbers (there were team 1,3,4,5)
- when you have to draw, to have something flashy, as for now it's confusing  - warning that it's my turn to draw
- increase the guessing time
- fix chat auto-scroll
- when you want to send the guess, press enter and it goes automatically to the guessed word options
- the interface should be clearer, it causes confusion
- remove the "known bug" - "There are no users in the db"
- the colours are too high contrasted, white foreground on dark background, rounder corners and change the colouring (improve UX)
- improve the progress bar, make the teams not overlap each other, maybe stack them
- Every time a round starts, everyone rejoins
- fix left part scroll, you can only scroll the teams
- put the timer on top of the canvas, or on the sides, bigger so you can see it easily

- "red text in blue color is killing me. I would try to use vivid colours. Lookup colours and emotions and colours wheel, colours that blind together well." (chat)

- make snapshots with the game and ask for design feedback
- J4NN1NK should have infinite emeralds
- When I have to focus on the canvas, it's difficult to focus on the time as well
- add some warnings that the time is almost up (5 seconds left, guess the word!!!)
- when the round is finished and the word is guessed, show on the canvas
- fix left side "top picks team 1" - to show the right team you're in
- spectator don't get the canvas cleared
- the two boxes on the top should be centered or something
- clear the confusion between the emeralds and shards, make it clear in the screen, left top box
- tool tips - hover over items to tell you what they are
- make sign up and login forms the same size
