### Communication tools

For communicating and sharing information with other project members, the following tools are to be used:

- Discord - A common server is used for voice/video calls, screensharing and pair programming, as well as the primary chat tool and permanent record of all team communication. Members in the server are labelled with the role of the sub-group they belong to. Multiple channels are available for members to use depending on the context necessary.
- OneDrive - A shared OneDrive folder is used to grant access to the shared timesheet for all project members to log their tracked project time.
- GitLab - The issue board is used as the single source of truth of assigned items and project state. Issues and merge requests are assigned to discrete project members, with the possibility for members to leave review notes, and manage active items. GitLab is also the central store for _all_ project documentation (in markdown format).
- Email - Used to formally communicate with the publisher and other stakeholders/
- Physical meetings - Used for standups, and publisher presentations.
