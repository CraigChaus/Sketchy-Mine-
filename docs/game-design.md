//TODO: Write game design

- multiple diamonds per level
- multiple levels
- each team has a progressbar to reach the door (end of level)
- the progressbar shows how much diamonds you found already and how much is still needed
- each team has to collect all diamonds
- To reach a diamond, a distance (progressbar) must be dug. This distance is increased as an added difficulty for each higher level
- Every time a team guesses a correct drawing, a said amount of distance will be dug. 2nd, 3rd and others who guessed the word later will get a smaller dig distance. If no-one guessed the word, every team except the drawing team will get a very small digging distance added.
- If every team other than the drawing team guessed the word, the drawing team will get a box containing items. This can have a percentage to immediately give a diamond. Else, it can give buffs, such as immediate digging distance, increased digging distance for x rounds, etc.
- Player rankings are increased for every player in a team when they get a diamond (EmeraldPoints, based on level difficulty)
- Moderators can (de)buff teams by temporarily increasing or decreasing a teams digging distance. Moderators can also kick teams for inappropriate behavior
- In the guessing team, every team-member must agree on one word to submit before the time runs out. Once the word is submitted, no new guess can be made. It is not shown to other teams who made what kind of guess or if the guess is correct

Teams:
- 1-30 players
- Minimum 3 teams
-
