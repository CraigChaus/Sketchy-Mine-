## Code of Conduct

### Article 1 - Acceptance of Code of Conduct and new versions

_§1_ All team members, who are considered as members of this team (team no. 2) by the official Excel sheet of the group members list agree to this code of conduct automatically and declare they are aware of said rules and accept them.

_§2_ Upon publishing the code of conduct to the team's repository (GitLab), the committer of the document containing the code of conduct must inform all team members about the existence of the code of conduct within 24 hours of publication. Written proof must be present of this.

_§3_ Once the document containing the code of conduct is published, all team members must read the code of conduct within 72 hours (3 days). Once 72 hours passed, all team members, who have been informed by the code of conduct's publisher (with written proof) are considered to have read and accepted the code of conduct, considering no objections have been raised.

_§4_ Once a team member is notified about of the publication of a version of the code of conduct, team members must decline articles and/or individual paragraphs within 72 hours after the publication of the code of conduct. If a team member declines the publication of the code of conduct, they must act under the definition of paragraph 6. If no reaction is made, or they do not act under paragraph 6, that means the team member accepts the code of conduct.

_§5_ Once the first version of the code of conduct is published, changes to the code of conduct may be made. A new version to the code of conduct may only be made after 120 hours passed of the last version's publication. Once 120 hours passed, a new version may be published under the same procedure describe in Article 1, paragraph 1 to 4.

_§6_ If a team member decides not to agree with a section of the newly published code of conduct, they must inform all team members about the section they are not in agreement with. In this case, within 48 hours, all team members must agree on a change. If this does not happen, the original version will stay in act.

### Article 2 - Strike definition

_§1_ A team member may be given a maximum of 3 strikes. Upon receiving the third strike, under the definition of the manual, the team member is removed from the team.

_§2_ A strike may be issued to any team member once they do not follow any point the code of conduct, however, issuing a strike is not mandatory. A strike can only be issued if the majority of the team agrees to issue the strike. There must be written proof of said agreement.

### Article 3 - Communication rules

_§1_ The online (long distance) communication between team members is to be performed using the shared group server in Discord. Thus, all team members must have a free account registered on Discord. Said software must be installed both on everyone's main working computer and on their personal mobile phones. Notifications must also be enabled for at least the group server to make sure team-members are aware of new messages from other team-members. This is to ensure proper team communication and to make sure that all team-members are aware of new meetings, tasks and other important information regarding the project.

_§2_ Whenever an important decision is made, or a request is made, a written proof must be made of said act that all team members can see.

_§3_ If a meeting is planned (online or physical), the meeting must be planned at least 48 hours of the planned event date. All team members must be informed about the planned meeting. Once planning is made in said manner, everyone, who doesn't give within 24 hours an expectable written reason to be absent, must be present in the meeting (online or physical). If a team member doesn't react to a meeting plan within the given time, they are considered to be aware of the meeting, and they shall therefore attend it.

_§4_ If a team member is not able to attend physical meetings due to lockdown, quarantine or if said person is abroad for an extended period of time, they then--if appropriate conditions (internet, well being, etc.) are met--must attend the physical meetings online.

### Article 4 - Work agreements

_§1_ Every team member's work must be uploaded to the team's GitLab repository. The only exception applies to the time sheet (Excel document) which is located in a shared One Drive folder.

_§2_ Every written document, that is not code, must be written in Markdown format (.md file).

_§3_ Every team member is responsible to solve merge conflicts themselves. It is neither the SCRUM master's nor the branch merger's task to solve merge conflicts. Whenever a merge conflict occurs, the one, who wrote the original code that is now causing the merge conflict, must solve the issue.

_§4_ Team members must implement their SCRUM backlog items in a separate branch and rebase their branch on the current master branch when it is ready to be reviewed and merged. Nobody is allowed to work on the master branch, as it is protected.

_§5_ Each team member must push their functioning commits to the git repository at least 1 hour before the agreed and announced deadline. If a team member is unable to finish their task in time, they must at least publish a subset of the work, indicating the status. This work must still be pushed to the upstream repository, so others can use said work.

_§6_ If a team member is "hard stuck" (cannot progress anymore alone with their task), they must ask help from others. Simply not completing their tasks is unacceptable. They must inform the team about this situation 12 hours before the agreed and announced deadline for their work.

_§7_ Whenever a team member has done any work (either alone or together with someone else) that is related to the project, they must record their working time on the team's time sheet.

_§8_ Once an announced meeting happens (online or physical), that is planned 24 hours prior (in other words, it is not an ad-hoc meeting) and no notice was provided 12 hours prior the meeting about being late, a team member is considered to be absent after being late by 15 minutes.

_§9_ Whenever a team member produces any work, it must be usable work by other team members. Usable work is defined as work that is generally complete, clear and interpretable by other team members.

_§10_ Deadlines for work and scheduled group meetings must be announced 24 hours before the actual deadline. Said announcements must be written down. The announcer must make sure everyone knows the deadline. Agreements must be made if said deadline is not suitable for a team member.

_§11_ Whenever someone has done any work, whether code or documentation related, they must inform all team members in any way that their work is completed.

_§12_ In git commit messages, the author must give a basic description about the changes that their commit contains. Commit messages must be 'semantic', prefixed with keywords such as "chore", "feature", "fix".

_§13_ In git, branches must follow the 'git flow' naming convention, and track referenced issues from the Gitlab issue board.

_§14_ In git, all branches must be automatically created from the issue board, and linked to their issue and associated merge request. Team members should not manually create arbitrary branches.

## Sprint retrospectives

### Sprint 0

#### What accelerated us

- Clear plan on who has to do what
- Having a todo list
- Issues on gitlab (with labels, assigned members, etc)
- Working in only one environment (GitLab)
- Visual Studio Code live share (pair "programming")
- Having a game idea that doesn't rely on a game engine
- Having everyone in our Discord group so we can all communicate easily with each other

#### What slowed us down

- Communication
- Agreeing on game specifics
- Not everyone read the manual
- Enforcing standardized usage of git (commit messages, branches, issues, etc)
- Onboarding new members, who weren't there during the original planning phase

#### Future plans

- Having organized and scheduled meetings as agreed by the team
- Familiarizing everyone with the standard git rules
- Having a celebratory meeting after every sprint to boost the moral of the team, e.g lunch, mangoes and drinks
- Being more specific on deadlines and meeting times
- Clearly working in our defined sub-groups instead of as one large group (individual scrum masters, ambassadors, etc)
- Making tasks clearly explained to follow a uniform standard as agreed byn everyone in the team

####Schedule
- Standups: Monday, Friday (every week); 
- Publisher meeting: Monday (8.03.2022);
- Sprint review (Sprint 1): Monday (8.03.2022);


#### Communication tools

For communicating and sharing information with other project members, the following tools are to be used:

- Discord - A common server is used for voice/video calls, screensharing and pair programming, as well as the primary chat tool and permanent record of all team communication. Members in the server are labelled with the role of the sub-group they belong to. Multiple channels are available for members to use depending on the context necessary.
- OneDrive - A shared OneDrive folder is used to grant access to the shared timesheet for all project members to log their tracked project time.
- GitLab - The issue board is used as the single source of truth of assigned items and project state. Issues and merge requests are assigned to discrete project members, with the possibility for members to leave review notes, and manage active items. GitLab is also the central store for _all_ project documentation (in markdown format).
- Email - Used to formally communicate with the publisher and other stakeholders/
- Physical meetings - Used for standups, and publisher presentations.
